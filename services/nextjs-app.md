title: NextJS app development
---

It's no secret that creating single-page JavaScript applications can be pretty challenging these days. Fortunately, there are some projects available which simplify things and help you build apps faster.

Even still, there's a high learning curve before you can build a proper application. That's because you need to learn about client-side routing, page layout, and so on. If you'd like to perform server-side rendering for faster page loads, things can become even more difficult.

Think about how webapps are created with PHP. You create some files, write PHP code, then simply deploy it. We don't have to worry about routing much, and the app is rendered on the server by default.

That's exactly what we do with NextJS. Instead of PHP, we build the app with JavaScript and React.
