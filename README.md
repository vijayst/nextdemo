# nextdemo

This demo app produces a static site by converting some markdown files into HTML. But that is not it. There are
some great features:

-   Styles using CSS modules
-   Images in public folder
-   Customise \_app.js for common Layout
-   Dynamic routes
-   Examples of getStaticProps() and getStaticPaths()
-   Export next project

*   The project is updated for NextJS 11.
